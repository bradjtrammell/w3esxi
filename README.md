### -- In active development -- 

This is a module for WHMCS to communicate with VMWare ESX servers. The original version of this module was designed for PHP 4 and PHP 5, I'm developing and testing on PHP 7 with plans to include support for additional PHP versions.

This version is actively able to be used, please report any issues in the "issues" tab. 

Credit to the original author for creating the script.
